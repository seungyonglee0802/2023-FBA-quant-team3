# Sentiment Score from News Title

This project calculates the sentiment score for news titles using various techniques, including ChatGPT and Word2Vec. It provides a way to analyze the sentiment of news titles and potentially gauge their impact on stock prices.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `crawler.py`: Python script to crawl and scrape news titles from a specified source.
- `main.py`: Main script that executes the sentiment analysis process using different methods.
- `sentiment_score_chatgpt.py`: Python script to calculate the sentiment score using the ChatGPT model.
- `sentiment_score.py`: Python script to calculate the sentiment score using other sentiment analysis techniques.
- `word2vec.py`: Python script to vectorize text using Word2Vec and perform dimensionality reduction.

## Setup and Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run main.py `python main.py --query TESLA --num_pages 3 --plot --gpt`.

- The `--query` option specifies the query term for news titles. Replace TESLA with your desired query.
- The `--num_pages` option specifies the number of pages to scrape for news titles. Adjust the value as needed.
- The `--plot` option generates a plot of the Word2Vec figure.
- The `--gpt` option uses ChatGPT for sentiment analysis. Omit this option to not use ChatGPT.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary API keys, such as the ChatGPT API key, and update the respective scripts with your keys.

- Adjust the sentiment analysis models and parameters as needed to improve accuracy and adapt to your specific use case.

- Feel free to modify or extend the project to incorporate additional features, such as different vectorization techniques or sentiment analysis libraries.
